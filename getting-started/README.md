# Next JS Introduction

### What is NextJS

- The **React** **Framework** for **Production**
  - `React`
    - We still write React code, we still build React components and use React features (props, state, context, ...)
    - NextJS just enhances our React apps and adds more features
  - `Framework`
    - Lots of built-in features (e.g. routing) that help us solve common problems and clear guidance on how to use those features
  - `Production`
    - There are certain problems which we will need to solve for almost all production-ready React apps: NextJS solves those for us
- A **FullStack** framework for ReactJS
- NextJS solves common problems and makes building React apps easier

### NextJS - Key Features and Benefits

- Server Side Rendering
  - Automatic page pre-rendering: Great for SEO and initial load
  - Blending client-side and server-side: Fetch data on the server and render finished pages
- File based Routing System
  - Define pages and routes with files and folders instead of code
  - Less code, less work, highly understandable
- Full Stack Capabilities
  - Easily add backend (server-side) code to our Next/React apps
  - Storing data, getting data, authentication etc, can be added to our React Projects

### Initialize a NextJS Project

- `npx create-next-app hello-world`
